## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project is a system that will be provided to the client which aims to increase the rate at which users of the system are able to pass their drivers exams.
The application and related systems will allow student users to be able study materials, take practice tests, schedule in-person driving lessons with an instructor, and see their history of coursework.
The administrators of the system will be able to track users changes to their accounts and in person driving registrations. 

## What did you do particularly well?

The coursework related to this project does a good job of giving a focused depictions of various aspects of the system. This includes UML user diagrams that shows from a high level different functions the various actors in the system will use the system for, activity diagrams which blend use cases with logical functionality of the system, and class diagrams which show the blue prints that outline properties of how object will behave as well as relationships between classes and their associated attributes and methods.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The UML class diagram did not require methods to be included, while this particular version of the assignment does include basic accessor and mutator functions some of the more nuanced functions were not included.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

While participating in discussions around building the documentation for the projects, many of the other students in the class did not fully include all of the requirements as stated by the client. This particular submission includes articulated needs that others commonly left out such as the admins of the system to be able to change users passwords and track various changes with user data in the system including registrations. 
These are important, because if the functionality is not documented it most likely will not be developed and the project will fall short. The client could lose trust and be frustrated which could lead to finding another vendor and losing their business.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

It's very important to make sure that the system diagrams and documentation are complete before moving on to any downstream tasks associated with starting a project. One of the main reasons is stakeholder buy, prioritization of various teams, and the resources available to ensure that all needed development can feasibly be completed when needed.
